# Learning from Scrimba --> [FontEnd Career Path][1]

It has 12 sets of modules. Each module compromises a set of learning by doing projects and each section has some solo projects. (Except Module 1)
Here, I write about all the projects and what I have learned from the projects.

### Current Active Module: [Module 3]

---

## Module 1: Welcome to the Career Path (10 Lessons, 25 min)

It has some basic introduction to HTML & CSS. The projects here are not very important that's why I don't mention them here.

---

## Module 2: Web dev basics (113 Lessons, 6 Hours and 10 min)

In this module, I got to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I created some instructor-led projects and one solo project.
